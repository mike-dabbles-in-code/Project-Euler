coding practices with "https://projecteuler.net/"

Here I am attempting to solve some of the problems as they can be found on "https://projecteuler.net/".
The goal is to practice functional programming methods and make this visible. Please feel free to use any code you fancy. 
I am open to all kinds of improvement suggestions and welcome collaboration. The Git is under the MIT license:
